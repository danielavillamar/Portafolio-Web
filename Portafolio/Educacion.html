      <br>What I am currently studying?
    </h3>
    <h4>
      COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br>I am currently studying at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala where I have had the opportunity not only to know what it means to be an engineer, but also to finally do what I like. Within my first years in college, I have been part of the basketball club, dance club and vice president of the computer blog. I feel lucky to currently have a very close relationship with Engineer Douglas Barrios, director of the computer science degree, who has supported me from day one. I am at UVG not only because of its excellent reputation but because of the opportunity it offers its students to grow and at the same time be part of the world that advances with technology. The university also gives me the option to choose a specialty within my career, I am currently on Video games. I like it so much that I have even been the teacher assistant in the course since it is a field in my career that I would like to continue to specialize in the future. Below you will find some of the projects that I have been working on in the past years where it shows how much I know -related to my carrer- and what kind of material I like to work on -my creativity-.

    <h4>
      Videogame: Quitting
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br> The task was simple: Design a 3D game with a free theme. The game platform will be PC. Games must have innovative elements and not be clones of other existing games.You can check out the game and even try it yourself. This is our first prototype:<br><br> https://itch.io/jam/proyecto-libre-game-design-2021/rate/1068506?before=2#post-3528081
      <br><br> You can check out the complete final document of the "behind the scenes" creation of the Videogame. It shows from the story behind the game to the future plans we have for it:<br><br> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hIkh2B7jJ0o6zn0xHXCo0zaMZoR1FK_sknzvMNtke8Y/edit?usp=sharing

    <h4>
      <br> My personal Twitter 
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br> This was a free project form my web course where they asked me to try to copy any site using all or some of the technologies we learned in class. This time I challenge myself to copy the Twitter site applying some frontend and backend knowledge I was learning in another class.  
      <br> Here in my GitHub repository you will find a README file that specifies what you have to do to run the program correctly:<br><br> https://github.com/danielavillamar/PWeb.git
    </p>
    <h4>
      <br> My personal Spotify 
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br> The project contemplates the use of Database technology for the creation, modeling and construction of data models, with the aim of using SQL language for research, development and presentation of results on business questions to support decision-making. Generally, it consists of the implementation of a mobile, desktop or web application that uses a relational database to support a music streaming service for independent artists, that works under a freemium model of user subscription paying an optional membership on a monthly basis.
      <br> Here in my GitHub repository you will find a README file that specifies what you have to do to run the program correctly: <br><br>https://github.com/danielavillamar/PBases.git
      <br><br> Top 3 techologies that I used in this project was: Bootstrap, React and MongoDB.
    </p>
    <h4>
      <br> Online Chat
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br> This is a JavaScript project that I did on my web course. We had to create a chat site that was going to be uploaded in the server of the class. You had to be able to send messages –including photos and gifs files- and receive from the ones connected to the same chat server. We could not use HTML or CSS besides script you will find in my project.

    <p>
      <br><br>I graduated from the APDE Entrevalles in 2018. I completed all my education at the same institution. Within it I learned the values in which I believe and apply today. Without a doubt, I think I had the opportunity to be in one of the best schools in Guatemala. At school, I always stood out as one of the best students in the class, recognized by math and science competitions, extracurricular activities such as the Volleyball, Choir and Athletics team also in my Senior Year I was part of the student council. During my last years at school, I obtained my Bachelor of Science and Letters but also the IB Diploma. The IB Diploma is designed for students between the age of 16 and 19 years old. It is based on the philosophy that students should apply critical thinking skills to their experiences and learn to assess the world around them. The course encourages the development of students’ academic, social, emotional, and physical wellbeing, and prepares them to participate in our global society through the comprehensive study of six subjects and three core components over two years. The program is also widely recognized by the world’s top universities as it gives students the right skills and attitude needed for higher education.
